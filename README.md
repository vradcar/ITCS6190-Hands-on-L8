---
## **Prerequisites**
Before starting the assignment, ensure you have the following software installed and properly configured on your machine:
1. **Python 3.x**:
   - [Download and Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```

2. **PySpark**:
   - Install using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install pyspark
     ```

3. **Faker**:
   - Install using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install faker
     ```

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Project Structure**

Ensure your project directory follows the structure below:

```
ride-sharing-analytics/
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task_1
â”‚   |    â””â”€â”€ CSV files of task 1.
|   â”œâ”€â”€ task_2
â”‚   |    â””â”€â”€ CSV files of task 2.
|   â””â”€â”€ task_3
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ CSV files of task 3.
â”œâ”€â”€ task1.py
â”œâ”€â”€ task2.py
â”œâ”€â”€ task3.py
â”œâ”€â”€ data_generator.py
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- **data_generator.py/**: generates a constant stream of input data of the schema (trip_id, driver_id, distance_km, fare_amount, timestamp)  
- **outputs/**: CSV files of processed data of each task stored in respective folders.
- **README.md**: Assignment instructions and guidelines.

### **2. Running the Analysis Tasks**

You can run the analysis tasks either locally.

1. **Execute Each Task **: The data_generator.py should be continuosly running on a terminal. open a new terminal to execute each of the tasks.
   ```bash
     python data_generator.py
     python task1.py
     python task2.py
     python task3.py
   ```

2. **Verify the Outputs**:
   Check the `outputs/` directory for the resulting files:
   ```bash
   ls outputs/
   ```

## **Overview**

In this assignment, we will build a real-time analytics pipeline for a ride-sharing platform using Apache Spark Structured Streaming. we will process streaming data, perform real-time aggregations, and analyze trends over time.

## **Objectives**

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

1. Task 1: Ingest and parse real-time ride data.
2. Task 2: Perform real-time aggregations on driver earnings and trip distances.
3. Task 3: Analyze trends over time using a sliding time window.

---

## **Task 1: Basic Streaming Ingestion and Parsing**

1. Ingest streaming data from the provided socket (e.g., localhost:9999) using Spark Structured Streaming.
2. Parse the incoming JSON messages into a Spark DataFrame with proper columns (trip_id, driver_id, distance_km, fare_amount, timestamp).

## **Instructions:**
1. Create a Spark session.
2. Use spark.readStream.format("socket") to read from localhost:9999.
3. Parse the JSON payload into columns.
4. Print the parsed data to the console (using .writeStream.format("console")).

---

## **Task 2: Real-Time Aggregations (Driver-Level)**

1. Aggregate the data in real time to answer the following questions:
  â€¢ Total fare amount grouped by driver_id.
  â€¢ Average distance (distance_km) grouped by driver_id.
2. Output these aggregations to the console in real time.

## **Instructions:**
1. Reuse the parsed DataFrame from Task 1.
2. Group by driver_id and compute:
3. SUM(fare_amount) as total_fare
4. AVG(distance_km) as avg_distance
5. Store the result in csv

---

## **Task 3: Windowed Time-Based Analytics**

1. Convert the timestamp column to a proper TimestampType.
2. Perform a 5-minute windowed aggregation on fare_amount (sliding by 1 minute and watermarking by 1 minute).

## **Instructions:**

1. Convert the string-based timestamp column to a TimestampType column (e.g., event_time).
2. Use Sparkâ€™s window function to aggregate over a 5-minute window, sliding by 1 minute, for the sum of fare_amount.
3. Output the windowed results to csv.
